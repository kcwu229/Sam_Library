This a full-stack application built using Spring Boot for the backend, 
React.js for the frontend, and a MySQL database. It uses RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend. 

This application is planned to containerize using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Docker Compose for web hosting.


I am now working on it ...
